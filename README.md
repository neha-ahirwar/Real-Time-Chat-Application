# Real-Time-Chat-Application
The real-time chat application is built using Node.js and Express.js, leveraging sockets for instant communication between clients and the server. Unlike traditional methods that involve server polling, sockets allow the server to push messages directly to connected clients, making the chat experience faster and more responsive. The application includes a simple HTML webpage with a form for message input and a message list for display. Overall, it provides a more efficient way for users to communicate in real-time.

- Notify connected users about new connections or disconnections through broadcast messages.
- Introduce support for user-customized nicknames, adding a personal touch to interactions.
- Enhance user experience by preventing message echoes; messages sent by a user are instantly appended upon pressing "Enter."
- Implement a real-time "is typing" feature to indicate when a user is composing a message.
